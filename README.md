# Loan-Default-Analysis

This is an extension of a Kaggle kernel created by Ionas Kelepouris.  The data for this analysis can be found on kaggle.com at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/credit-risk-modelling-eda-classification/data.  

First step in the analysis is to perform EDA and feature selection.  Feature selection in this model is based on business knowledge, as I am a financial analyst at a credit union.  Next, I use a logistic regression to build a model.  The AUC was relatively low, so in an effort to improve the model I utilize different sampling techniques.  Utilizing over and undersampling I was able to improve the AUC.

In the future I will utilize different feature selection techniques to select additional features for the model.
